# Lichee Pi Nano Bootable Linux Image (Buildroot)

![Lichee Pi Nano with LCD screen](licheepi-nano-lcd.jpg)

[Lichee Pi Nano](http://nano.lichee.pro/index.html) ([English article](https://www.cnx-software.com/2018/08/17/licheepi-nano-cheap-sd-card-sized-linux-board/)) is a very small single-board computer that is about the size of an SD card. It can run Linux. There is a good amount of official documentation on the [original manufacturer site](http://nano.lichee.pro/get_started/first_eye.html) (in Chinese, but easily readable thanks to Google Translate). However, the tooling used to build the full card/SPI-Flash images is mostly made up of custom shell scripts, and is not always easy to extend or maintain.

This repository contains a Buildroot config extension that allows all of those build steps to be handled via a single Buildroot `make` command. That means fully building the U-Boot image, Linux kernel, the rootfs image and the final partitioned binary image for flashing onto the bootable SD card (SPI-Flash support is possible but not handled here yet).

This heavily borrows from the work done by the FunKey Zero project: https://github.com/Squonk42/buildroot-licheepi-zero/. That repo targets Lichee Pi Zero, a sibling board to the Nano, but I was able to adapt it for use with the latter, and also converted the content to be a `BR2_EXTERNAL` extension rather than a full Buildroot fork.

There was reasonable effort to keep config files readable, e.g. here is the main Buildroot defconfig file: [configs/licheepi_nano_defconfig](configs/licheepi_nano_defconfig).

## Dependencies

- Vagrant (if building inside the VM)
  - vagrant-vbguest plugin
  - vagrant-disksize plugin
- Ubuntu Bionic or similar (see Vagrant VM)
- Buildroot 2020.02 (auto-downloaded by VM, otherwise see [project downloads page](https://buildroot.org/download.html))

Buildroot takes care of downloading any further dependencies automatically.

## Building the Image

If performing the build inside the VM:

```sh
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

Otherwise, download Buildroot and extract it into a folder.

Before building, install these Ubuntu packages:

```sh
sudo apt-get install swig python-dev fakeroot devscripts
```

If there are still error messages during later build, try installing these (sorry, did not clean up the list yet, some might be unnecessary):

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y chrpath gawk texinfo libsdl1.2-dev whiptail diffstat cpio libssl-dev
```

Then, create initial build configuration:

```sh
# if not using VM, change /vagrant to location of this repo
BR2_EXTERNAL=/vagrant make licheepi_nano_defconfig
```

Customize Buildroot configuration if needed:

```sh
make menuconfig
```

Proceed with the build:

```sh
make
```

The build may take 1.5 hours on a decent machine, or longer. For a faster build, try changing configuration to use external toolchain. I have tried building with Linaro GCC 7.5, but ran into crashes at time of `/sbin/init` invocation (issue with bundled glibc?).

A successful build will produce a `output/images` folder. That folder contains a `sdcard.img` file that can now be written to the bootable SD card. For example:

```sh
sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=DEVICE # e.g. /dev/sd?, etc
```

On Windows, Rufus or Balena Etcher can be used, or another utility like that.

## LCD Screen Support

This build includes a DTS file that supports a 480x272 TFT screen (plugged into the 40-pin flex-PCB connector on the board). The custom kernel branch also includes a DTS file with support for 800x480 TFT resolution: use `suniv-f1c100s-licheepi-nano` name for the DTS file, and update `boot.cmd` and `genimage.cfg` to reference that device tree as well.
